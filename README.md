## Current Implementation

The application currently features a simple text input form that:
- Accepts user input through a text field
- Provides a submit button for sending the input
- Uses modern styling with Tailwind CSS
- Is fully responsive and mobile-friendly

## Security

- API keys and sensitive information should be stored in the `.env` file
- The `.env` file is gitignored and should never be committed
- Use `api_keys.json` for local development (also gitignored)
